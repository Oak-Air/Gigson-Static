				<h3>About Swipemax</h3>
				<p>SwipeMax is a product design and Software engineering company in Lagos, Nigeria. They work with amazing companies and built notable products such as LindaIkejiTV VOD Plaform.</p>
				<p>
					In May, Swipemax decided to try Gigson to hire a full time developer. This wasn’t their first time using the bot in the community but this time around they decided to use the tailored service. We used our Job description creation tool to understand precisely the type of developer that would suit their technical & business needs.
				</p>

				<p>
					In no time, Gigson recommended 3 candidates with a 92% match on the Job description. These developers were introduced to Swipemax and an interview was set up shortly after. By the end of the week, one developer was selected and scheduled to resume the following monday. Based on their feedback, they would have loved to take all three but they only just needed one at the moment.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Dare’s review of the process, he mentioned that he would love to use Gigson going forward to save the headache and time of sieving through unqualified candidates.
