				<h3>About Schoolable</h3>
				<p>Schoolable is a fintech company that focuses on providing access to affordable finance in the private school system in Africa.</p>
				<h3>Schoolable ramps up their tech team with Gigson</h3>
				<p>
					Schoolable is going after a big problem in Africa - access to finance. The problem affects every facet of the economy including education. To solve a big problem such as this, a very capable team is needed. Financial technology is an area where expertise and experience matter a lot.
				</p>

				<p>
					In a bid to quickly scale up their tech team, Henry, CEO of Schoolable used Gigson to get shortlisted candidates within a week. Gigson recommended developers based on their past projects, years of experience and other external recommendations. We also conducted a coding test to verify the developers’ ability. The interview process with Henry was very simple and conducted over Skype with the developers. In less than a month, developers were selected and onboarded to the Schoolable team.
				</p>
				<p>
					Henry summarized the entire process as stress-free, fast and affordable, as the talent were well within the Company’s budget.
